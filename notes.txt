#IMPORTANT QUESTIONS :- 
1.why use react:- 1. it will boost speed of development
2.why use hook :- using it we can access state management functionality provided by react
3.to stop event bubbeling use e.stop.propagation  

#IMP ABOUT USEREFF
1. when state variable changes then re-render happens
2. when ref variable changes no re-render happens
#USECALLBACK
in this if inside React.memo -> wrap -> component -> component re-render tabhi hoga jab props change hoga nahi toh nahi hoga
if you are sending a function in component then React.memo can't save from Re-rendering
#USECALLBACK is important to handle expensive opeations
#REDUX TOOL-KIT
TERMS USED :- Action, Reducer, Slice, Store, State
Action :- It is event only or addition of event + additional info.(it is just an object only) 
Slice :- we can create slice for particular feature in we need state management
Reducer :- are just function using which we can update or change data as per our logic.
Store :- single source of truth
State :- data
to use REDUX
steps :- 
1. create Store
2. wrap app component under provider
3. create Slice
4. register reducer in Store
#state se koi bhi data orvalue ko fetch or use karne ke liye useSelector hook ka use karna padta hai
#Action ko execute karane ke liye use dispatch karna padta hai use dispatch karane ke liye useDispatch hook ka use karna padta hai
asyncThunk search it in REDUX documentation and read it
